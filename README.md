Software design project - end of sophmore year. 6/15/22

This was an open ended final project to demonstrate what we learned. The requirements were as follows:

  - Develop your original program using all skills you have learned. This includes :
    - Conditional code and logic
    - Functions/control flow
    - Looping
    - Arrays/Vectors/Matrices
    - Classes/Structures
    - Error-trapping/Data validation
    - Data Sorting
    - Data Searching
  - Target your original program so that it can tackle a real-life problem!

our group decided on a program that could serve as software for an ordering kiosk at a subway-style sandwich shop.
